## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a practical understanding of fundamental concepts in programming languages, including lexical analysis, parsing, interpretation, and type checking. The project is organized to progressively build these components, allowing for a hands-on learning experience using the C programming language.

## Features

- Lexical Analyzer: Tokenizes input source code into a stream of tokens.
- Parser: Analyzes the token stream to create a syntax tree.
- Interpreter: Executes the program represented by the syntax tree.
- Type Checker: Performs static analysis to ensure type correctness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/))
- [Any other dependencies, libraries, or tools]

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mugishompozi/programming-languages-concepts.git
